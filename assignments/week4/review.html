            <p>This Movie is truly the magnum opas of humanity. I cry myself to sleep at night knowing I was born after the crowning achievement of mankind, and am now cursed to witness the downfall and inescapable collapse of society as we know it. every year older this movie gets, another mile traveled from the garden of eden and the light of God. for this Movie is the only barrier between society and  destruction by our own acursed hands. I can only hope to be delivered from the inpending maddness by an angel of the sponge, to be carried away from this decaying world, like how Spongebob and Patrick traveled the sea upon David Hasselhoffs broad, muscular chest.

            Anyway, <em>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</em> is a very enjoyable watch for any spongebob fan. The plot is fun and diverges just enough to be fresh for the series but not so much that its out of place. Compared to the newer movies,  <em>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</em> keeps true to the soul of the franchise with the classic light-hearted humor and tomfoolery the show is known for, but has some heartfelt moments as well. I would recomend this movie to just about anyone.

                <h3>Trivia</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>Intended to be the series finale of SpongeBob SquarePants (1999), the show was renewed for a fourth season due to the film's success and the show's popularity. Further episodes were told to take place before the events of this movie, but this was confirmed to be untrue by the show's cast and crew, who have claimed that the show has "never really been chronological".</li>

                    <li>Final Nickelodeon animated movie to be released on VHS.</li>

                    <li>An 11-foot long David Hasselhoff figure was built so cameramen could film without straining the real Hasselhoff.
